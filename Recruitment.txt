I. Recruitment

Recruitment is the most commonly utilized skill in the Human Resources community.  Recruitment is the practice of hiring the best candidates for the position identified.   Employers want to hire employees who will stay, “fit”, and perform the skills required to successfully complete the job, and also provide for a talent base that can be eventually promoted to increasingly higher levels of management.  Prospective employees want to get a job, but they also want to understand the job and the company, the overall benefits and work-life balance, and the enjoyment they may gain from a career at the firm.  It is the job of the Human Resources Recruiter / Manager to balance these needs across multiply currently open jobs, and multiple candidates asking to be considered for these positions.  It is also important that this person maintains the integrity of the process: that managers believe they have been provided the best candidates available, and that candidates feel like they have been treated fairly and equitably and that the company has indeed chosen the best candidate available.  
A. Development of Job Specifications.   The recruiter needs to fully understand the needs and wants of the hiring manager with respect to the job.  HR representatives quickly find that the best way to have this dialogue with a manager is to refer to past hiring:  either find a job description / job posting from a prior similar job, or point to an employee in the organization and get a references of “just like him/her with these changes.”  Then, both to document the conversation and hold for future reference, the recruiter will develop a job requirements form to use as the basis of finding the right candidate.  One easy way to keep track of the knowledge, skills and abilities (ksa’s) within the functional area is to have a previously defined study of job competencies within a career path.   The job competencies listing can go a long way helping the recruiter to identify characteristics of a successful interview candidate.  More on job competencies in the Organizational and Employee Development section of this book.  

B. Internal Advertisement of the Opening.   Internal job posting systems carry the message to current employees that a position is available for qualified candidates to bid.  Because management cannot have constant turnover of employees, most companies have a policy that you must have been employed in your current job for a minimum length of time, typically 18 months to 2 years, before you are eligible to bid on the advertised opening.   The posted job will contain duties and expectations of the job, requirements of the successful candidate, and details regarding the job (hours, pay range, location, etc.).   Most job posting systems today are online, so they can track directly to an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) for Affirmative Action Plan (AAP) purposes.  Why do companies use internal job posting systems?  To provide a perception of fairness and consideration to all employees.   While it is possible the most qualified candidate is outside the company, most companies feel that their current employees can grow and learn to meet the qualifications of most jobs.

C. External Job Posting Systems.  Advertising externally is a necessity when internal candidates do not entirely satisfy the expectations of the hiring manager for the job.  Some companies automatically share their internal job postings with external job boards such as Monster.com, Indeed, or CareerBuilder because they wish to calibrate internal candidates with what’s available from the outside.  Plus, it’s easier and quicker to have it all handled at one time with one process.  The Applicant Tracking Systems that are often connected with these job posting boards provide complete candidate information regardless whether they are internal or external.  Other than job boards, available recruitment of outside candidates is done by any media (newspapers, television, radio, job fairs, LinkedIn, even Twitter), but depending on the success rate, some of these are rather expensive (newspapers, for example).  Some companies advertise and interview on a prior-to-need basis and develop applicant “pools” of qualified candidates ready to interview and hire on short notice.  This can significantly reduce the time to fill a position. 

D. Recruiters, or “Headhunters” and their role.  Typically companies will seek an external recruiter to find candidates for them, particularly if the regular advertisement processes do not produce the type of candidates desired.  The use of such recruiters will normally broaden the range of the search conducted, and a discussion needs to be held regarding whether the company will help fund the relocation of an individual from outside the local area.   External recruiters get paid by the company who is hiring, and are typically paid between 20% and 30% of the first-year salary of the successful candidate.  They will act as the initial screen (first phone interview), determine how supportive they can be regarding the candidate, and then decide whether to present that candidate to the hiring manager.   

E. Competition of internal bid candidates vs developmental candidates.  Companies will normally have previously-identified candidates for development who need particular types of assignments.  When one of these types of assignments opens, and there is a developmental candidate, a decision must be made as to whether this is the right time, place, or assignment to put this developmental candidate.  A discussion needs to be held with either the hiring manager or, more likely, the leader of the function to determine the readiness of the candidate and the applicability of this assignment, vs the implied commitment to the general employee population that all available jobs are posted with the opportunity for them to be considered.  It seems like a waste of a job advertisement / bid process if you know for sure this assignment will be filled with the developmental candidate; however, sometime function leaders will choose to see who else is available and interested first, possibly withholding the developmental candidate for a later assignment.  (Often, the developmental candidate is not even aware that this discussion is going on.  However, there is always the risk that while waiting, that developmental candidate may find a similarly situated assignment with another company and take flight.)

F. Identification of first-pass candidates with a large number of candidates.   Inevitably candidates will apply who have insufficient credentials to even consider.   A quick screen of resumes will identify those, or an ATS can normally screen minimum qualifications for you.  Beyond that, comparing resumes can be tricky business, and any new practice should be discussed with legal counsel before creating a process that might inadvertently impact a protected class.  (Example: in looking for a highly promotable candidate, using promotability as a decision criteria ultimately is likely to negatively impact older workers.)  One practical (and quick) way of looking through a large number of resumes is to develop a matrix of candidates vs. job requirements, and give each resume a rating by requirement of a point factor 1-10 (whatever).  Adding up the points by candidate can provide you a quick summary of highly qualified, marginally qualified, and minimally qualified candidates.  Then decide how many you want to interview and move forward from the top of the list.   Example is below.

* Education:  HS Dip = 1, Some college = 2, BA-any = 3, BS-any = 4, BS-relevant field = 5, MS = 6
* Experience: 1-3 years – any = 1, 1-3 years – directly applicable skills = 2, 3-5 years – any = 3, 3-5 years – directly applicable skills = 4, 5-10 years – directly applicable skills = 5, 10+ years – directly applicable skills = 6
* Skill 1:  Trained/schooled in skill = 1, Short tenure – schooled and familiar but not a lot of use = 2, Mid tenure – trained or not = 3, Long tenure – trained or not = 4, Long tenure + certified = 5, Long tenure + trainer of others = 6, etc.
G.  Resume screening once we have a smaller number of candidates / resumes.   How do you read a resume?  What do experienced eyes look for?    How do I avoid unconscious bias?  How do I go about prioritizing one candidate over another?    Consider the following examples.   These are real candidates for a real job in Marketing Communications, although the identifying information has been changed.  

<candidate1> <candidate2> <candidate3> <candidate4> <candidate5> <candidate6> <candidate7>

Discussion Points and Exercise.
* Working independently, would class members have largely chosen the same candidate as the most likely to successfully interview for the position?
* What things do you feel you need to know about the candidate in order to recommend them to the hiring manager?  
* What kinds of things do you feel you know about the person(s) after looking at their resume?
* What kinds of things do you still feel you do not know about the person(s) after looking at their resume?
* Discuss as a group who you think the two most likely candidates are to move forward.  One of these 7 candidates was the actual hire.  Can you guess which one?
* During the course of your class discussion about the candidates, how many of the group changed their mind about a particular candidate, given the perspective provided by other class members?  Do some class members have a stronger opinion than others about a particular candidate?  
* Do you think you or other class members may have some hidden or unknown bias regarding any of the candidates?  How would you know?
o Discuss the following critical study on resume bias.
* Now after you have reviewed and discussed them as a class, develop a common matrix (as suggested above) for review of the 7 resumes.  Once you develop an agreed-upon scale based on the job description provided, independently rank the candidates 1-7.  How close were your final rankings?  Where did you agree / disagree?  What other findings do you have about this process?  Does the ranking change who you believe will be the successful hire?
* Finally, look at the below regarding perspectives from an experienced resume reviewer (relatively harsh, I apologize, but being critical is important to narrowing the field).  How do the perspectives provided by the resume reviewer differ from the class?  

<Candidate 1 Annotated> <Candidate 2 Annotated> <Candidate 3 Annotated> <Candidate 4 Annotated> <Candidate 5 Annotated> <Candidate 6 Annotated> <Candidate 7 Annotated>

** SPOILER ALERT!! ** Answer to exercise question below.  
In the above process, more than 180 different candidates applied, and a matrix process was used to narrow down only the minimum qualifications (college degree in a reasonably business related field).  Six candidates were interviewed (only two in the list above), three of the interviewed candidates were invited back for a second interview, and one was hired.  The manager of the job was highly participative and engaged in the process, which always helps the process flow.  The successful candidate in this particular process was candidate #6. 

H. The Interview Process.   Once you’ve been invited to participate in an interview, the process moves quickly.  By this time, the manager is highly engaged and will help drive the process forward to completion.  Most interview processes involve the visit of several candidates, and the interview team is charged with selecting the one best individual to suit the needs of the business.  An interview day will often consist of an opening meeting with an HR representative, including a discussion on who you will see today, a brief tour of the facility, and often some sort of assessment of fit or qualifications (normally online).   

* How many interviews during a typical interview day?  Depends on the job.  Senior level or mid-level positions can normally expect 5-6 interviews in a day.  For jobs with more specific technical qualifications or entry-level, expect 2-3 at most.  Interviews are typically ½ hour to 45 minutes each.  More sophisticated hiring processes will take a list of competencies questions and divide them categorically depending on the background / skill of the interviewer, and often pair up interviewers (one asking questions, one taking notes).  You should think through in advance the kinds of questions you may be asked and write down or otherwise prepare the kind of response you would provide.
* What kinds of questions?  Every interview is different.  Many interview processes will have behaviorally-based questions, e.g. “tell me about a time when”… in order to have you detail what you did do in this particular circumstance, rather than what you would do (or what someone should do).  The specifics around the retelling of a particular incident hold a lot more credibility than what the theoretical perfect person should do.  Some technical interviews will share a particular scenario about what you would do if such an event occurs, to determine your level of understanding and more importantly your thought process as you talk the interviewers through the situation.
* With multiple interviewers will I get repeat questions?  Expect yes.  You should also expect that they will compare notes with one another later, so your answers should be consistent.  If you find that you erred in a prior interview, don’t compound the error – simply note that you gave the wrong answer previously and since you’ve had the chance to think about it, here is the correct response.  
* How does the interview team reach their decision?  Typically they will consider each individual separately, even if multiple candidates are presented for a single opening.  In order for process integrity to hold, there must be some way for less-strong individuals on the team to have their say before the strong voices take over and sway everyone in the meeting.  Some groups vote on paper, some choose an instantaneous thumbs up-thumbs down, and after that initial response a more robust dialogue can take place, normally led by the recruiter or the HR representative.  They consider all feedback, take good notes, and finally have a discussion with the hiring manager on what he/she feels.  At that point the decision is made.
* What am I supposed to wear to the interview?  Ask that question to the person who invites you to attend.  Every company culture is different; the most important thing is that you honor the interviewer and the interview process by dressing appropriately.  Wear comfortable walking shoes and expect to walk a lot during your day.  Dress to show that you care about the process, or the process will not care about you.  
* What should I bring?  Bring 6 copies of your resume, a folder or envelope to carry them, and a pen to take notes.  If you have business cards, bring them as part of the introduction process (they are not really needed, but a nice formality).  Shut off your cell phone and for heaven’s sake do not answer it during your interview – that will be the end of your candidacy. 
* What preparations should I do prior to the interview?  Review your resume to remind yourself of the key experiences you have had in your career to date, particularly those which are relevant to the position for which you are now interviewing.  Have at least one question in mind regarding the future of the business or how this job fits into a broader picture.  Do not ask the interviewers about salary or benefits – that discussion is far more appropriate with the HR person at the right time.  (It also sends the signal that you only want the job for the money, not the best message.)  Visit glassdoor.com and the company’s website in advance, to give you a better perspective on what it’s like to work there.  
* Do I discuss volunteer or personal activities?  Yes, but our recommendation is only if they can demonstrate some positive quality that may be applicable to the position:  leadership roles, excellent communications or problem solving, team skills, commitment to very hard work or effort, etc.  
* What if I’m asked about limitations or areas in which I’m weak?  Answer honestly.  There is nothing wrong with having a “developmental opportunity”; best answers identify that you have previously identified this developmental area and “here are the three things I’ve already started doing to overcome these learning points”.  
* Should I follow up with a thank-you note after the interview?  Not required, but it is a nice gesture.  Most interviewers do not expect it.  However, if you haven’t heard anything after a week or so, it does help to express your continued interest in the position.  Email is fine.  
* What are practical limitations / pitfalls in the interviewing process?
o Group sway.  In an ideal process, immediately following each interview the interviewer will sit down for 10 minutes or so and fill out a form with detailed notes on his assessment and opinions regarding the candidate.  In a busy business setting, ideal process does not always occur and the group of interviewers may get together with only a portion of them having fully completed their paperwork.  Hiring managers who have a very strong voice can sway the entire group of interviewers unless those interviewers are also strong individuals.  Some teams will decide that unless 100% of the interviews are positive, they will continue looking.  There is also the risk that during the interview day, interview team members will compare notes before the meeting.  They need to be encouraged to not do so, at risk of not being part of the future hiring process.
o 11-second decision making?  It is said that interviewers make up their mind in the first 11 seconds of the interview, and anything that is said after that is meaningless.  I don’t know how true it is, but it does highlight the fact that all interviewers should be properly trained in how to ask relevant, meaningful, and appropriate questions and given a process to follow.  It is not a correct assumption that anyone knows how to conduct an interview.  Plus, experienced interviewers should learn to form an early opinion in his/her mind about the candidate, and spend the remaining time collecting data that either confirms or contradicts that early opinion.  These things come with experience, good interviewer training, and the integrity to seek out the best possible candidate. 
o Skills vs. “fit”.  Practically speaking, what I have seen is that most hiring managers spend 90% of the interview time figuring out what the person knows about the subject matter and the skills required to be successful in the job.  (This makes for easier startup training for the individual.)  However, also practically speaking, rarely is an individual brought to HR for future exit because of his/her technical skills; far more often it is the cultural fit of this individual in the environment.  We often call that “how well they play with others”.  Therefore it has been my practice as an HR professional of many years to focus on the non-technical skills: communications, attitude, personal drive and motivation, success factors, etc.
o Long term re-calibration.  HR teams truly interested in improving interview teams’ effectiveness should consider a long term strategy of comparing interview team notes and written results regarding hired candidates 1-2 years after these candidates began employment.  A recommended exercise is to choose 5-10 new hires after a year of employment and compare them to the last 5-10 new hires who didn’t work out and have subsequently left the organization.  Get their employment files, pull out the notes from the interview teams, and compare the notes of the successful employees vs. the unsuccessful employees.  What can the differences tell you about things we may have seen but ignored during the hiring process?  If there are no differences, are there other things about the departed employees that we should be inspecting during the interview?

I. Special Hiring Source: University Campus Recruiting.   Many companies utilize university campus recruiting as a means to fill entry-level, internship, or leadership development program positions.   Colleges and universities regularly hold career fairs to introduce employers to students ready to be considered for these jobs.   
Given the nature of the career fair environment and the time limitations (employers may see hundreds of candidates in the 4 to 6 hours of a career fair), both candidates and employers need to be prepared for rapid assessment and conclusion of the discussion so each party can move on.  
Candidates need to come fully prepared with extra copies of resumes and a pen / notepad to take notes.  Dress properly, according to the standards of the career fair.  Know which employers you wish to see, and do a little bit of homework checking out current events at the firm.  Be prepared to tell them a little bit about yourself, your interests, and your particular skills in two minutes or less.  Tell them when you graduate, whether internship is a possibility, major and minor, and one major successful project or experience during your college years.  Talk about any leadership roles you have held in any college organization or program.  Know what geographical locations fit for you and what your potential dates of employment are.   Candidates who are successful sharing their key traits and skills as a fit for the company may get invited to a campus interview at a later time.  A copy of a typical campus interview guide may be found here.  
Employers need to have a plan for how to move along candidates taking too much time compared to the average discussion.  Set up a booth that tells the candidates a little bit about your company and your current hiring needs without the candidates needing to ask.  Establish a process for preliminary screeners to pass strong candidates along to a second, more experienced interviewer for more serious evaluation.  Have a method for identifying and keeping track of all the resumes because at the end of the fair, they all tend to look alike.  
Hidden Career Fair Secrets.   
* Many employers hold information sessions the night before the career fair.  Attend if at all possible, and take the opportunity to stay and meet some of the employer team after the session.  If you are at all interesting, they will remember you.  Plus, most employers bring free food to these sessions!
* Be sure to check the college’s Placement Office website prior to the career fair.  Many employers post information about their interests and expectations on the website so you can have advance information of what they seek.  In many cases you can pre-register for a campus interview to improve your odds of talking with a recruiter on campus.  If you do get a time slot for a pre-registered campus interview, make sure you take time to stop by that employer’s booth to demonstrate your level of interest and get to know your interviewers a bit in advance.
* The best candidates visit an employer booth knowing specifically what type of employment they seek, and having a practiced 90-second speech identifying skills and interests.  After the initial 90 seconds, the employer will ask some question about what he/she has heard and the discussion begins.  You can signal the end of your intro speech by asking a question of the employer, it may be as simple as “what is it that you most want to find in a successful candidate” or “can I give you a copy of my resume”?
* If you have a special story, tell it.  At the end of the career fair the employer’s team will be looking at a stack of possibly successful candidates and a limited number of campus interview time slots.   The stack of resumes all start to look alike.  Anything that can allow a member of the team to say, “Yes, this was the guy who came back from overseas military assignment last year and completed his degree in 12 months” or “that was the single mother raising three kids who completed her Engineering degree at night school for 3 years” is a huge advantage.  
* The worst candidates approach an employer booth with no idea who the company is, what they are about, or why they are hiring, and no speech or story about themselves.  If you are this guy, move along to another booth; you are wasting your time and the employer’s time.  Or, alternatively, make up a 90-second speech quickly and tell them things about yourself, and let the employer guide you through the rest.
* Employers often have trinkets or small tokens available at the booth.  If you get handed one of these early in your conversation with a member of the employer team, move along.  It’s a sign that your conversation is over and they’re ready to move to the next candidate.  Focus your time on an employer where you have a chance.
* High-GPA candidates get rejected regularly if they cannot demonstrate that they have done something, preferably team-oriented or leadership-oriented (public service is also nice), outside of the regular classwork (except for highly technical jobs).  Think about your past and any kind of community or club assignment where you held a leadership role, even for a short-term project or a special event. 
* If you can secure an internship prior to graduation, get one.  Internships are one of the best ways to demonstrate your skills and get hired for a full time position.  Internship work experience also provide tremendous perspective for your classwork after you return to campus.   Since a successful internship will often lead to a full time job offer, be very selective about the companies at which you choose to apply.  This decision process begins as you are doing your preparatory work prior to the career fair, including visiting the Employer Informational Sessions prior to the fair.     
* At the end of the career fair, most employers do not want to take the giveaways back home.  They start trading with one another.  If you come back just as they are starting to take down their displays, you might be able to pick up some extra goodies!

J. The Pipeline.   Organizations often develop a “talent pipeline” for particular skills.   Entry-level candidates such as those identified by the career fairs may find themselves being considered for functional Leadership Programs in categories like Engineering, Manufacturing, Finance, Human Resources, Logistics, Information Technology, or other areas.  These programs are often two or three years in length with multiple rotational assignments and additional training in particular skills or leadership development.  Other more technical roles, such as Maintenance Technicians, may be found through a Union Hall or external hiring process and then placed in an Apprenticeship program.  These programs typically last 5 or 6 years with additional training or college coursework required as well.  All of these “find and develop” programs allow the organization to build particular pipelines of career talent in different areas.  If you aspire to a particular job you eventually intend to hold, look for companies that have development programs in that functional area / job category and find out what requirements are necessary to be successful in gaining entry into that program.  

K.  The Legal Aspects of the Interview Process.    A true review of the legal issues regarding the interview process requires much more time than we plan to spend here.  We are not lawyers, nor do we pretend to dispense legal advice.  However, from a practical standpoint, it is important to know the following things:
a. There are questions that interviewers can ask that could lead a candidate to believe you are engaging in a discriminatory hiring practice.  Therefore, all interviewers must be thoroughly trained to focus on what are commonly known as BFOQ, or Bona Fide Occupational Qualifications.  Even if these questions are not asked in the formal interview setting, if they are asked, they are asked.  Examples include: “Do you belong to a club or social organization?”  “How long do you plan to work before you retire?”  “Is this your maiden name?”  “How many sick days did you take last year?”  “Do you have children?”  Any questions that are not specifically about the skills and qualifications required to successfully perform the position, leave to the trained HR interviewers.
b. Now, if you are the candidate and you get asked a question that’s clearly not appropriate or potentially discriminatory, please recognize that most non-HR interviewers asking this type of question have little or no idea that what has been asked may lead to discriminatory practices.  It’s an awkward situation with few graceful ways out.  You may try redirecting back to the interviewer, “Family seems important to you.  Do you have children?”  Or, you may be somewhat more straightforward.  “Help me to understand why this matters, so I can better understand the job I’m interviewing for.”
c. The notes that interview team members take during the hiring process are also discoverable during a legal proceeding.  Do not write notes that might lead to allegations of discriminatory practices, such as “may need long maternity leave in the near future” or “not sure this person can stand long enough every day to do the job”.  While these might be valid concerns regarding the employer’s ability to manage the situation, leave these kinds of potentially legal issues to the trained HR team.
d. Any issues regarding physical limitations to do the job, prior arrest record, prior drug use, major ailments, personal lifestyle, military background (except on-the-job work experiences), pregnancy, religious practices even if the holidays conflict with current work schedules, US citizenship, and a number of non-job-related areas should be left up to trained professionals. 
e. One consideration is that if a candidate volunteers information of the above variety, that doesn’t mean the interviewer needs to stop the interview process immediately.  Out best recommendation is to make a mental note of that part of the conversation and discuss it with your HR representative and let him/her handle it appropriately.   Get back on track with questions of the BFOQ variety.  
f. Outside of the individual interview process, employers are required to keep track of candidates and site visits, EEO classification as can be determined, veteran’s status and disability status when known, and a record of the final dispensation of these candidates.  These are listed as part of an Applicant Tracking that is included in the Affirmative Action Plan for the organization each year.
