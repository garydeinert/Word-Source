I. Strategic Human Resources.

HR as a function is a continuum of types of work, from the administrative tasks of completing required paperwork, through the managerial role of trying to improve processes and efficiencies, to the strategic forms of HR, which focus on a number of the following subjects:
* Change Management and Leadership
* Executive Coaching
* Restructuring, Realignment, Acquisition, Closure
* Labor Negotiations 
* Culture Change
* Worksystems Design
* Lean Manufacturing
* Assessment Systems
* Communications Programs
* Vision – Mission Development and Alignment
* Human Resources Metrics
* Others

A. Change Management and Leadership.
Change Management and change acceleration processes are centered around the study of major organizational initiatives that are successful vs. those that have failed.  In fact, Dr. John Kotter of Kotter International concluded after years of study that 70% of major management initiatives fail and only 5% meet or succeed their objectives.  As part of the studies, theorists have developed categories of plans, actions, and tools that organizations should use to improve the chances of a major change being successful.
Change acceleration programs start with one basic tenet:  Q x A = E.  That is, the Effectiveness E of a change is a product of two primarily elements:  the Quality of the change Q and the Acceptance of the change A.  Highly technical organizations tend to overdo and continually improve the Quality of a change, like building a better mousetrap, possibly spending enormous effort improving something that employees or customers don’t want.  (One study found that 100% of successful change initiatives had high quality – but also that 98% of unsuccessful change initiatives also had high quality.)  Not-so-technical organizations will often find themselves encouraging employees or customers to embrace a lower-quality program with enthusiasm.  Extremely rare are the programs such as the Pet Rock (incredibly high Acceptance but really limited Quality) or the Concorde (incredible technological Quality but its Acceptance limitations eventually restricted its success).  
Most change models have categorized the key elements of successful change similar to these:
1) Leading Change – Visible champion, active public commitment, support for the change
2) Creating a Shared Need – Reason to change widely understood and communicated
3) Shaping a Vision – Clear, understood commitment and direction for the change
4) Mobilizing Commitment – key constituents invest in the change and commit to its success
5) Making Change Last – Change flourishes, endures, and integrates well with other key initiatives
6) Monitoring Progress – Progress is real, benchmarks set and realized, indicators established
7) Creating Systems and Structures – other management practices are supportive and complement the change
Kotter’s model is very similar to the above.  Change management practitioners become familiar with the success models and also become trained to utilize a “toolkit” of exercises or processes to help management meet the success factors of the change models.  Working within the toolkit requires the HR professional to coach and counsel senior management in developing a better understanding of how their change initiative can be modified to meet objectives yet improve its chances for success.

B.  Executive Coaching.
One concern of business leaders is the succession plan, the identification of candidates within the organization to have “readiness” for a particular role, normally focused on the top roles in the firm.  Very rarely is there unequivocal agreement on who may be ready to take on the role of the CEO, CFO, or Executive Vice President, and therefore an industry has spawned in executive coaching to help provide feedback, guidance, and development to those interested in seeking such positions.  With success of executive coaching programs, some middle-management individuals have voluntarily participated in such programs to enhance chances to eventually succeed to a senior management role.  
Executive coaching normally begins with a set of competencies that are expected for success in the particular role and then an assessment of the individual against those competencies.  Particularly in the case of senior management, technical and management skills for a particular function become less important, and broad-based skills like effective communications, community relations, strategic planning, and organizational strategy emerge as development areas for candidates.  The executive coach will then partner with the individual to provide feedback and develop a plan for how to enhance these skills over a reasonable time frame.  Ongoing assessments are performed, and at some point the executive coach reports back to the sponsoring senior management on his or her assessments on the progress of the individual.  

C. Restructuring, Realignment, Acquisition, Closure.
This is a very specialized area within the Human Resources function, and there are few practitioners with real expertise in these types of projects.  When a firm is challenged with a change in strategic direction or unfavorable performance of the business unit, the response is likely to be one of the 4 choices above.  Restructuring normally means a realignment of resources within the firm to more effectively meet the business climate or cost structure needed to be competitive.  In short, it often means outsourcing some internal functions (like graphic design, facility maintenance, office supplies management, employee healthcare, or machining) or reducing the internal resources available to perform like functions.  A realignment may simply be the reallocation of resources to different areas within the firm, with or without outsourcing or staff reduction.  Acquisition is normally the opposite of outsourcing, where the firm seeks to add to its portfolio because having the function report directly to the firm may be advantageous in either management direction, future development, or cost.  Closure is simply the process of determining whether to exit a business unit, site, or program and either relocate the work to another division or stop doing it entirely.  In the 1980’s, Jack Welch of GE left a very clear directive to the leaders of his business units:  if a product or program is not #1 or #2 in its marketplace, the leaders had to make a decision:  fix, sell, or close.  
Strategic Human Resources decision making in this area is not typically the root decision of what direction to take (although there are instances where human capital advantage is a key strategy), but more often how to support and carry out the strategic objective.  For example, we have decided to try to fix this business unit.  This likely means restructuring to better meet cost and profit objectives, including some outsourcing of non-core technologies.  The HR leader will be challenged to face decisions such as:
* What are our core technologies?
* What business functions are not cost effective?
* What can we do to make them cost effective?
* If we choose to outsource, what criteria do we use to decide?
* What is the timing of the plan or program?
* If restructuring, how many headcount can our profit model support?
* If restructuring, when?  What process will you use within that timeframe to determine who stays and who goes?
* Not knowing yet who stays and who goes, who can I enlist to help with this project?
* How do we keep this decision making process from becoming a political mess?
* What are our restrictions and limitations (e.g. legal, labor contract, community) to this project?
At this stage one of the best things the HR leader would be able to do is to develop a structure and process for decision making and review the process with senior leadership.  Because the concept of divesting programs and people is a very sensitive topic, there will be many personal or hidden agendas and a likelihood of different goals among managers and leaders involved in the decision making.  Clear, compelling vision is required, agreement among key constituents is required, and a process for decisions that is perceived fair will also be necessary.  It will be important that communications are clear and concise, but also appropriately confidential depending on the audience, because a miscommunication will tend to have your best employees seeking new opportunities outside the company while you are trying to retain them.  Many of the right tools for success in the program can be found in the scope of Change Management Acceleration toolboxes, mentioned above.  

D. Labor Negotiations.  
The strategic side of labor negotiations is ‘what do you want your labor relationship to be like after the negotiating is over’.  With the different types of negotiation strategies that you can employ as well as the different tone you can set with the daily interactions you have with your labor representatives, you can set forth a labor strategy that is in concert with your overall organization and employee relations strategy.  By communicating your direction to the union and keeping on a clear and even directional path toward that direction, you can continue along that path and you may even get some assistance from your labor representatives if they are invested in your vision.  
E. Culture Change.
Clearly your organization’s culture is a strategic advantage, but only if it aligns with your firm’s vision and direction.  If you haven’t taken the time to translate into behavioral or actionable terms the way you want your organization to look after you’ve achieved your vision, you should go through a process of figuring those things out.  Amazing the number of companies that believe their culture is appropriate, aligned, or downright perfect but they have no means of measuring, tracking, or even articulating that culture.  Many companies use climate surveys to get anonymous employee opinion about how the culture is progressing and working.  In order for these to be effective, however, the expectations for the culture either now or in the future must be articulated in terms that people can understand (in order to figure out whether you’re “close” or “not close” when you look at climate survey results).  
F. Worksystems Design.
High-Involvement Worksystems (HIWS), High-Performing Worksystems, Team-based Worksystems, Pay-for-Skills Worksystems, Traditional Worksystems – these are all terms used for the employment relationship and daily activities of employees within the content and structure of your work environment.  Each of these Worksystems supports a different environment, culture, and vision for your business, and there is a body of knowledge somewhere between the “pure HR” and the “Training” specialty areas within Human Resources.  
G. Lean Manufacturing.
Lean Manufacturing, Continuous Improvement, Six Sigma, Total Quality Management, and other similar philosophies drive a particular support structure and process focus regarding employees and Human Resources.  Related to the Culture Change discussion above, each of these is often developed as part of an overall culture and woven into a worksystem in such a way that employees work habits, duties, expectations, and environment are very different than that found within a traditional setting.  Since these programs are enormous in nature and often take years to articulate and then introduce into the complex organization, commonly found among HR practitioners in these environments is a “phase progression” plan that sets out a multi-year plan with specific behavioral indicators for the culture (perhaps through climate surveys).  This phase progression document can provide a cultural roadmap for HR to focus their efforts on improving cultural elements that are specific and identifiable.  
H. Assessment Systems.
Sometimes in spite of their best efforts, organizations find themselves struggling to attract and retain the best talent, and one of the reasons is often a lack of clarity among interviewers/assessors on what that talent “looks like” from a recruiting perspective.  One way to augment and support the process are assessment systems that provide a specific and independent viewpoint of a candidate compared to a particular profile or expectation.  One form of assessment system is the Assessment Center, a series of events such as role plays, interviews, “in-basket exercises”, and scenario responses designed to better understand how a candidate reacts and thinks in given situations and scenarios so we can better understand how they may operate in our environment.   Another system commonly used is an online assessment, which typically will pair an examination of technical skills necessary for the position with non-technical and behavioral profile characteristics required for success in the job.  One advantage of online assessments is that professional assessment firms (which I strongly recommend using) are skilled in the establishment of behavioral assessments that are not discriminatory in nature and also developed to specifically fit the job in the environment identified.  One way they do this is to compare results of the assessment from individuals currently successfully employed in the role and the working environment, to determine factors that statistically correlate to success and failure – rather than just using conventional wisdom or manager opinion.  
I. Communications Programs and Planning.
Communicating a complex plan or program to a variety of different constituents associated with an organization requires skill and effort.  The best way to ensure you’re keeping on track is to establish and follow a formal communications plan.  It’s not difficult, but it is amazing how many organizations fail to plan in advance of the actual communications.  
Communications planning structure is very straightforward:  It’s a map of –
* What’s the message?
* Who’s the primary audience?
* When and where is it to be delivered?
* Who will deliver it?
* What media will be used to deliver it?
* What is the desired or expected response of the message?
Develop a grid that has fill-in boxes for all of these items and keep going over and over it until it flows the way you expect things to flow.  I also recommend writing down “Q’s and A’s” to share with secondary communicators to help support the message.  These also need to be written and then shared with other senior management, modified, and back again, over and over until the specific message is developed.  They then can be shared with middle management with the expectation that they understand and can verbally communicate the exact message in order to respond appropriately and with factual detail to the concerns of the employee population.  
J. Vision – Mission Development and Alignment.
Often HR practitioners become part of the development of vision and mission statements because of their facilitation and communications skills.  However, it’s more important that they are engaged in the creation of organizational mission and vision since they are a key representative of the overall employee population.  Vision can be identified as “where are we going” and Mission can be identified as “what road map are we going to follow to get there”.  The hardest part of developing vision and mission is gaining true alignment and commitment from senior management, and it can be a significant role for the HR leader to play to understand the comments and concerns from each party and seek to gain alignment across the board.  The most important part about developing these is the commitment that the entire organization makes to carry these out; otherwise the development of a vision and mission that people don’t understand or follow is a waste of time.  
K. Human Resources Metrics.
HR Metrics is the body of knowledge that identifies the indicators that the HR function is performing the way it should in order to support the vision, mission, and needs of the overall organization.  Typical metrics include Time-to-Fill (from the original communication of open job until the new employee starts), grievance rates (number of grievances filed and argued at each step in the procedure), turnover (average hires & exits per year divided by the size of the employee population), absenteeism (number of absences per worked hour), OSHA recordable incident rates, cost per hire (includes sourcing, orientation, relocation, training, etc. of a new employee), and other metrics.  There have over many years developed some rather standard calculations for a number of these metrics; I would refer to either the Society of HR Management (SHRM) or the work of Jac Fitz-Enz, an author who has written several books on managing the HR function.
